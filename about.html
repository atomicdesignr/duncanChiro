<hr>
   <p>Susan Duncan D.C., C.C.S.P., F.I.A.C.A. received her Bachelors of Science
   degree from Pennsylvania State University. She continued her education at Palmer
 College of Chiropractic to graduate Cum Laude. After graduation, Dr. Duncan worked
as a falculty member for 10 years while starting her own practice here in the Quad Cities.
Dr. Susan Duncan has always been an avid sport enthusiast. During her high school career,
she participated in swimming, cheer, and was the captain of the gymnastic team.
As a hobby, she rode her horse in trail events and contended in the show ring. <br><br>

Skiing also had a significance in her time outdoors. She competed in the Rocky Mountain
Freestyle Championships; taking second place overall in three events. After one
season skiing in Winter Park Colorado, she rode her bicycle from Denver, Colorado
all the way to St. Joe, Missouri. <br><br>

Since marrying a Quad City native, she and her family look forward to riding the RAGBRAI. <br><br>

Our clinic strives to provide the atmosphere and opportunity to apply the education,
general knowledge, and ability to a wholistic approach to your wellness.
